# BaTii CRM Ticket Volume Forecasting

## Background
BaTii is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system used within the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia to manage and resolve service tickets.
Accurate forecasting of ticket volume is important for capacity planning, workload distribution, and service quality improvement.

This project explores time-series forecasting approaches for predicting CRM ticket volumes using machine learning techniques, with a focus on modern deep learning methods.

## Research Objectives
- Analyze historical patterns of CRM ticket volumes
- Build a reproducible forecasting pipeline
- Evaluate forecasting performance under real operational constraints
- Provide insights applicable to public-sector IT service management

## Dataset
The dataset is derived from BaTii CRM ticket records.
Due to confidentiality and data protection policies, raw ticket-level data is **not publicly available**.

Only aggregated and anonymized data are used for analysis and experiments.
Details regarding data processing are documented in `data/README.md`.

## Methodology Overview
The research workflow consists of:
1. Data aggregation and preprocessing
2. Exploratory time-series analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Forecasting experiments
5. Evaluation and analysis

## Reproducibility
All preprocessing steps, experiments, and evaluations are implemented in a reproducible manner.
Configuration files and scripts are provided to ensure transparency and consistency.

## Project Status
🚧 Ongoing research — experiments and paper draft in progress.
